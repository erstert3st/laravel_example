  # TODO
#   Umask for running applications

# For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional -e UMASK=022 setting. Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up here‚Å†

# before asking for support.
# User / Group Identifiers

# When using volumes (-v flags), permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user PUID and group PGID.

# Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

# In this instance PUID=1000 and PGID=1000, to find yours use id your_user as below:

# id your_user

# Example output:

# uid=1000(your_user) gid=1000(your_user) groups=1000(your_user)
